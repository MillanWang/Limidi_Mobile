## Why the name "LiMIDI"?
If you say "melody" really fast, it kinda sounds like "milidi", and when I produce music, I like to rearange melodies. If you sample "mi-li-di", and do a quick chop & flip, you get "LiMIDI". 

Li can be translated to "strength" in Chinese, and the average user of this app will be strong with MIDI. 

LiMIDI is also a city in Italy, which is kinda close to the city Milan, and my name is Millan. Shout out to all of my Italian friends!
